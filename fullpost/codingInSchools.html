                <h1>Coding in schools</h1>
                <p>
                    The South African government has shown interest in introducing <a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/technology/419153/south-africa-finalising-new-coding-and-robotics-curriculum-for-schools/" target="_blank">coding in schools</a>.
                    This is commendable and should be followed up with implementation. The government
                    has a good track record of coming up with good plans (National Development Plan)
                    but there is so much to be desired when it comes to implementation. It may not come as a surprise
                    if there are concerns that the government may not be able to introduce coding in schools, due to
                    either lack of capacity or lack of political will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to successfully introduce coding in schools the government has to overcome two hurdles.
                    One, the provision of infrastructure, this include secure computer labs, computers and software that
                    is required for coding. Two, the provision of competent people to teach/facilitate coding to
                    primary school learners and high school learners. The government does not have a good record of
                    providing excellent school infrastructure. The government is still struggling, after more than 20
                    years in power, to eliminate pit toilets in schools. Political will is needed to ensure
                    implementation and that there is no corruption in the procurement of infrastructure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then there is a challange of finding the best approach to teach learners coding. In my experience
                    of having learned theoretical physics and programming/coding, I have realised that learning theoretical
                    subjects and learning programming requires different approaches. This might not be obvious because
                    if you take physics and JavaScript, for example, they can be studied by taking a textbook
                    study the theory and understand it and then do the exercises at the end of each chapter. In learning
                    physics this is a very effective approach but this is not the best approach to learn JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One might ask what is the best approach to learn coding? Well....our friends in the teaching
                    research have answers for that in the form of the pedagogy of teaching. In it simplest form
                    pedagogy is defined as a method, and practise of teaching. It includes teaching styles, teaching
                    theory, feedback and assessment. The pedagogical approach that I think is suitable for learning
                    coding is constructivism. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Constructivism is a theory that people learn through experiences and reflection. A Constructivist
                        pedagogy puts the child at the centre of the learning, and is sometimes called ‘invisible pedagogy’.
                        A constructivist approach would incorporate project work and inquiry based learning.<sup>1</sup>
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe the government must also be cognisant of the level of educational goals as described by
                    the Bloom's taxonomy. The revised Bloom's taxonomy titled <a href="https://catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu/discovery/search?query=any,contains,0321084055&tab=Catalog&vid=01VAN_INST:vanui&offset=0" target="_blank">
                    A taxonomy for teaching, learning and assessment</a> has six categories of educational goals.
                    The order of ideal attainment of these educational goals are arranged as a pyramid. The educational
                    goal at the base is "remember", the goal is for learners to be able to recall facts and basic concepts.
                    The next higher educational goal is "understand", the goal is for learners to be able to explain ideas
                    and concepts. The third educational goal is "apply", the goal is for learners to be able to use 
                    information in new situations. The fourth educational goal is "analyse", the goal is for
                    learners to be able to draw connections among ideas. The fifth educational goal is "evaluate",
                    the goal is for learners to be able to justify a stand or decision. The top educational goal is
                    "create", the goal is for learners to be able to produce new or original work.

                </p>
                <p>
                    If primary school learners can master the base category and high school learners can master
                    the second and third categories through using the constructivism pedagogy, I believe that
                    South Africa will be able to produce software developers that will drive the fourth industrial
                    revolution forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, for South Africa and the African continent to not just be consumers of technology but
                    producers and creators of technology the top three categories must be mastered. I believe that
                    Further Education and Training (FET) colleges and private colleges, like WeThinkCode_, in
                    partnership with industry are suitable in helping students achieve these educational goals and
                    drive innovation. Government must ensure policies and support structure that will encourage
                    students to be innovative and be able to protect and commercialise their inventions.
